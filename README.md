# PyCoord
PyCoord is a Python-based utility that allows users to select a rectangular region on their screen and automatically copies the coordinates of the selected region to the clipboard. It provides a GUI which makes it easy and intuitive to select areas directly on the screen.

# Features
- Fullscreen Overlay: PyCoord overlays a transparent layer on the entire screen, allowing users to select areas directly.

- Live Coordinate Display: As users create the selection box, the coordinates of the box are updated and displayed live at the center of the box.

- Interactive Confirmation: After a selection is made, users are prompted to confirm if they want to save the selection or redraw the box.

- Automatic Copy to Clipboard: Upon confirmation, the coordinates of the selection are automatically copied to the system clipboard for easy pasting and use in other applications. Users are also notified of this via a popup message.

- Lightweight and Easy to Use: PyCoord is easy to run and doesn't require any complicated setup or configuration. It's a simple and effective tool for grabbing screen coordinates quickly.

# Usage
To use PyCoord, simply clone the repository and run the pycoord.py script. Draw a box on the screen by clicking and dragging the mouse. Upon release, confirm your selection to have the coordinates automatically copied to your clipboard.
